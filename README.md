I'm a graduate of Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA) in Computer Information Systems and a minor in Graphic Communications Management.

I'm very active in the Boy Scouts of America and spend much of my time working with its national honor society, the Order of the Arrow. I earned the rank of Eagle Scout in June 2013. I've held a number of positions in both the Boy Scouts and the Order of the Arrow; most notably, I served as Secretary of Southern Region Section 7B, which serves the entire state of North Carolina. I also served two years as the National Videography Lead and four years as the National Visual Media Lead for the Order of the Arrow.

In the summer of 2017, I worked for WRAL Digital Solutions in Raleigh, NC, as a web designer and developer.

During the summers of 2018 and 2019, I interned at the Defense Intelligence Agency as part of the IT Business Policy and Process Management team. I hold a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) based on a Single Scope Background Investigation completed on February 13, 2018.

Throughout college I worked at the Holmes Convocation Center, which is operated by Appalachian State University, as a Production Team Member.

In June 2020, I began my career with Booz Allen Hamilton as an Experience Designer Consultant and was promoted a year later to Senior Consultant.

In April 2022, I joined CACI International, Inc. as a Senior Software Developer supporting the Chief Information Officer within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to modernize their internal and external web presence. In May 2023 I was promoted to a management position overseeing my previous team.

In July 2025, I joined Silveredge (now part of SAIC) as part of their Soar software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering. I am currently a DevOps Software Developer supporting the Intelligence Community's Chief Information Officer.
